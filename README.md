# dispatcher
Dispatcher is a simple Kubernetes job enqueuer. It uses job templates stored
in the cluster, and exposes an HTTP service to enqueue them.

It uses a job template
definition stored in a JobTemplate CRD, and it then executing it is done through
creating a JobExecution. Invoking a JobExecution can be done through its HTTP
API. Therefore, executing jobs doesn't require clients to know the actual job
template, but just the job's name.

## Description
The first step to use Dispatcher, is to have a JobTemplate (CRD) defined in
the cluster. The JobTemplate CRD defines the spec from
`batchv1.JobTemplateSpec`, so the syntax is the same as defining a CronJob or a
Job.

Given a JobTemplate like with the following definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: dispatcher.ivan.vc/v1alpha1
kind: JobTemplate
metadata:
  name: jobtemplate-sample
spec:
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: my-container
            image: alpine:latest
            command: ["echo", "$PAYLOAD"]
            env:
            - name: PAYLOAD
              value: "{{ .Payload }}"
          restartPolicy: Never
      backoffLimit: 0
```

It can be executed by manually creating a JobExecution (CRD), or by calling the
HTTP API endpoint. Although the former is possible, is the least desired way to
execute a Job.

Manually executing the previously defined JobTemplate, can be done by creating
the following JobExecution:

```yaml
apiVersion: dispatcher.ivan.vc/v1alpha1
kind: JobExecution
metadata:
  name: jobexecution-sample
spec:
  jobTemplateName: jobtemplate-sample
  payload: my test payload
```

The dispatcher controller will create a Job using the `jobexecution-sample`
template, and will feed `Payload` with `"my test payload"`. Therefore, the
output of the job would be just a simple echo of this payload.

The best way to execute the JobTemplate would be using the HTTP API endpoint, it
could be done by calling:

```bash
curl http://dispatcher-manager/execute/[namespace]/jobexecution-sample -X PUT -d
'my test payload'
```

Replace `[namespace]` with the actual namespace where you created the
JobTemplate. You can also configure a default namespace (by default it is
`"default"`), and omit the namespace from the URL path.

By running this, it will create a JobExecution, that will create a Job with the
payload that it received from the HTTP request body.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use
[KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run
against a remote cluster. **Note:** Your controller will automatically use the
current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl
cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/dispatcher:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/dispatcher:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
Pull Requests are welcome for new features. If you have any issues or ideas to
discuss, feel free to open an issue.

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator
pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses
[Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources
untile the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
